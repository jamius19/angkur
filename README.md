About
---
[Angkur!](https://angkur.xyz) provides beautiful Bangla Web fonts for developer everywhere via a simple API.
##### How it works?
Our web fonts are stored on GitHub and are loaded from Amazon S3. What this ensures is super fast load times. Also, at Angkur, we use latest WOFF2 font technology along with older WOFF, EOT, TTF and SVG formats for cross browser compatibility.

We use jsDelivr, CloudFlare and StackPatch as our content delivery networks for fonts.

##### Who's developing it?
Angkur is currently maintained by [Jamius Siam!](http://github.com/jamius19)
